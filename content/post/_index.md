As a secondary science and substitute teacher, a university teaching assistant and guest lecturer, and a college Psychology instructor at San Quentin prison, I have taught a full breadth of possible academic disciplines to students from age 7 to 70, who have been diverse in every conceivable way. This experience gives me the perspective, knowledge, and confidence to apply a diverse, multimodal, practical, and interactive pedagogy at the university level.

- Psychology 142/Human Development 102: Social and Emotional Development (Winter 2015)
