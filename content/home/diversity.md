As a white, cisgendered, heterosexual male, I recognize that my identity and outward presentation have garnered me unearned and unfair privileges in academia and in the world at large. 
As a scientist, teacher, member of a university community, and citizen, I am committed to: 
1. Continuously reflecting on and confronting my own assumptions and biases.
2. Doing my part to reform and dismantle oppressive systems, including those in academia.
3. Calling out instances of discrimination.
4. Teaching about the contributions of underrepresented people to science as well as the ways that science has been used as a tool for oppression.
5. Befriending, mentoring, learning from, citing, listening to, and elevating the voices of underrepresented and marginalized people, students, and scholars.
