As a secondary science and substitute teacher, a college Psychology instructor at Mount Tamalpais College in San Quentin prison, and a college professor, I have taught a full breadth of possible academic disciplines to students from age 7 to 70, who have been diverse in every conceivable way. Based on this experience I try to apply a diverse, multimodal, inclusive, practical, and interactive pedagogy at the university level. Links to course materials for all my courses can be found below. I've uploaded materials for my Mount Tamalpais College classes to OSF. Upon the completion of each semester, I will share the public canvas for all my classes at CSU Dominguez Hills.
